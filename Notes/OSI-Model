OSI Model (7 Layers)
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model divides network communication into seven layers:
1. Application Layer (Layer 7): This is the user-facing layer where applications like WhatsApp, YouTube, Instagram, and Google Meet operate. It handles tasks like sending messages, streaming videos, and providing the interface to interact with network services.
2. Presentation Layer (Layer 6): Responsible for data formatting, encoding, encryption, and compression. Examples include media encoding for images, videos, or emojis.
3. Session Layer (Layer 5): Manages sessions between applications, maintaining login states and persistent connections. For instance, a WhatsApp session or a video streaming session.
4. Transport Layer (Layer 4): Ensures reliable or unreliable delivery of data. Protocols like TCP provide reliability for messages and files, while UDP is used for real-time streaming where speed is prioritized over reliability.
5. Network Layer (Layer 3): Handles logical addressing and routing, using IP addresses to deliver data across networks. This is where routers operate.
6. Data Link Layer (Layer 2): Provides MAC addressing, error detection, and handles switching within local networks. Ethernet and Wi-Fi protocols operate here.
7. Physical Layer (Layer 1): Deals with the actual transmission of raw bits over physical media like cables, Wi-Fi signals, or radio frequencies.
