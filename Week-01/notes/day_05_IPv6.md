# üåê IPv6 Basics

## üìò Introduction

IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the latest version of the Internet Protocol, designed to overcome the limitations and address exhaustion of IPv4. Developed by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), IPv6 enables ongoing growth and future scalability for the Internet.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why IPv6 Was Needed

### 1. IPv4 Address Exhaustion
- IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, allowing only about 4.3 billion unique IP addresses.
- Growth in Internet-connected devices (IoT, smartphones, etc.), cloud computing, and "always-on" services led to a shortage of available addresses.

### 2. Workarounds Were Temporary
- Techniques like NAT (Network Address Translation) delayed exhaustion but brought challenges:
  - Complex configuration
  - Loss of true end-to-end connectivity
  - Difficulties in peer-to-peer communication

### 3. Scalability and Security Needs
- The evolving Internet needed:
  - A vastly larger address space
  - Simplified management
  - Built-in security (IPSec)
  - Efficient routing

IPv6 provides long-term solutions to these issues.

## üß© IPv6 Address Structure

IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, shown as 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits, separated by colons `:`.

**Example:**  
`2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329`

### Simplified Form
- Leading zeros in each block can be omitted:
  - `2001:db8:0:0:0:ff00:42:8329`
- Consecutive groups of zeros can be replaced by `::` (only once per address):
  - `2001:db8::ff00:42:8329`

## üß† Parts of an IPv6 Address

| Part                  | Description                                           |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Network Prefix        | Identifies the network or subnet                     |
| Interface Identifier  | Identifies a specific device/interface on a network  |

**Example:**  
`2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`  
- Network Prefix: `2001:0db8:85a3::`  
- Interface ID: `8a2e:0370:7334`

## üè∑Ô∏è Types of IPv6 Addresses

IPv6 supports three main types:

| Type      | Prefix      | Description                                                   |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unicast   | ‚Äî          | Identifies a single interface (one destination)               |
| Multicast | `ff00::/8` | Packet sent to more than one interface (replaces broadcast)   |
| Anycast   | ‚Äî          | Packet sent to the nearest of multiple possible destinations  |

### 1. Unicast Types

| Type             | Prefix        | Description                                                            |
|------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Global Unicast   | `2000::/3`   | Routable on the Internet (like public IPv4)                            |
| Link-Local       | `fe80::/10`  | For local segment communication only                                   |
| Unique Local     | `fc00::/7`   | For private networks (like IPv4 private ranges)                        |
| Loopback         | `::1`        | Host's self-test address (like `127.0.0.1` in IPv4)                    |
| Unspecified      | `::`         | Indicates absence of an address during initialization                   |

## ‚öôÔ∏è IPv6 Address Configuration

| Method                 | Description                                                  |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Manual Configuration   | Assigned by network admin                                   |
| Stateful (DHCPv6)      | Assigned via DHCPv6 server                                  |
| Stateless (SLAAC)      | Automatically configured using router advertisements        |

## üß≠ Transition from IPv4 to IPv6

Transition mechanisms are used because IPv6 is not backward-compatible:

| Mechanism     | Description                                                                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dual Stack    | Devices run both protocols simultaneously.                                    |
| Tunneling     | IPv6 packets encapsulated in IPv4 for passage through IPv4 networks.          |
| Translation   | Convert IPv6 packets to IPv4 (and vice versa) using NAT64/DNS64.              |

---

## üì¶ Real-World Adoption

- Leading ISPs, cloud platforms, and tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.) support IPv6.
- As of 2025, over 45-50% of Internet traffic uses IPv6.
- Modern routers and operating systems provide IPv6 support by default.
