# Week 1: OSI & TCP/IP Models

## OSI Model (7 Layers)
1. *Physical* – Hardware like cables, switches. Responsible for sending raw data.  
2. *Data Link* – MAC addresses, frames, and connecting devices in the same network.  
3. *Network* – IP addresses, routing between networks.  
4. *Transport* – TCP/UDP, ensures data is delivered correctly.  
5. *Session* – Manages sessions between apps (e.g., login sessions).  
6. *Presentation* – Encrypts/decrypts and formats data.  
7. *Application* – Apps we use like WhatsApp, YouTube, Browsers.

## TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
1. *Network Interface* – Physical + Data Link  
2. *Internet* – Network layer (IP addressing & routing)  
3. *Transport* – TCP/UDP  
4. *Application* – Apps like WhatsApp, YouTube, Browsers

## Hands-On Labs
- Created a simple PC + Switch topology in Packet Tracer.  
- Mapped daily apps (WhatsApp, YouTube) to OSI layers.  
- Started TryHackMe “Pre-Security → Intro to Networking” Module 1.

## Key Takeaways
- Data travels through layers from Application → Physical.  
- Each layer has a specific role in networking.  
- IP addresses act like “house addresses” for devices.  
- Hands-on practice helped me understand networking concepts better.
